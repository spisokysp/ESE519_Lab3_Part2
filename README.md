# ESE519_Lab3_Part2

In this part, a touchscreen is interfaced with our LCD. When the touchscreen is pressed on different position, the resistance in x-axis and y-axis is divided accordingly. When the axis is connected to 5v power, the divided resistance forms a voltage divider and provide different voltage with different touching point. We provide 5v to the touchscreen using Arduino output port and measure the voltage of touchscreen using the Arduino ADC.
